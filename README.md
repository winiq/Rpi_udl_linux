# This should boot on all RPi devices
# Current kernel is 5.15.74

Majortom & DarkSky's repository based off of V4L media_tree,
powARman's saa716x work, and Updatelee's work. With out 
Updatelees's hard work this would not be possible; Thanks UDL!

This is a modified kernel source for use with the Raspberry RPi's:
1/2/3B/3B+/4b that is used in our custom Arch Raspberry Pi image.

This kernel allows for blind scanning and playing higher bitrate
feeds from FTA satellite streams using Updatelee's program 
updateDVB. It is also excellent for ATSC use.

# Tested with:

The usb prof devices should work
Some usb TBS devices work
Skystar 2 eXpress HD
Genpix Skywalker-1
Hauppauge 950Q & 955Q
Some usb InDtube ATSC devices work pretty good

Others are reported working as well.
